Data processing pipeline in Pytorch
====

[Pytorch](pytorch.org) is a relatively newer deep learning framework compared to Tensorflow. But, it provides excellent features that makes it a framework you should checkout. Main features are **Dynamic Graphs and Typing**.

In this article, we will deal with Pytorch's Dataset class to load, transform and create minibatches for training neural networks in Pytorch.
